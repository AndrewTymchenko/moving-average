Tym's Lsn22

Computes the "moving average" for a stream of data points it is receiving. 
A moving average computes the average of the most recent N_AVG_SAMPLES points.
There are also two other functions that compute the maximum and minimum values in a given array.
And another function that computes the range of values in an array.
